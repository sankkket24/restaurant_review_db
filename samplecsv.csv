I would give this negative -4 stars if I could. I dine out all the time and have had better service almost everywhere. We had a reservation for 12 people (couples dates, plus 1 child) for 7:30. There were not enough sets of cutlery/bowls/cups of half of us, it wasnt a big deal but we did ask for more and didn't get any so we asked again, no utensils or anything to eat with until 15mins after the food was served hahahah. We ordered quite a bit of food, beers, and 3 iced teas-we didn't get the drinks until 40mins later when reminded again. We never got any tea or hot water to start off with throughout the whole meal.When we finished the appys no one ever came to remove the empty plates/even they came to put the main dishes on the table: and they clearly say there was no room, but kept trying to shove stuff over to fit everything. I got tired of all the clutter and started clearing it myself on to one of the many empty tables beside us. My friend asked for some more Kimchi side dish and they said we can't have more unless its a refill/ which I didn't understand so I said yeah ok/ I wouldn't mind paying for more anyways: 20mins later no kimchi, So I asked another waitress and she said we only do refills, so I asked her what she meant, (they mean like the will take the dish back and refill, you can't have another new small bowl of it), so I friend said sure anything works. She was so mad and aggressive saying ""what one, where is the plate?"" There are literally so many empty side dish plates on the table, but I said oh theres one right here. She screamed at me and said, ""well I cant see any, THERES NONE!!!"" then sighed loudly and walked away. We were all so confused. She came back 5 minutes later with some more kimchi and slammed them on the table and said, ""NEXT TIME MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE OLD DISHES!"", I replied with, ""Oops sorry I didn't know what you meant, theres so many side dish bowls here, we didn't clear them away""... she sighed and walked away.I used to waitress for 5 years, I would never treat anyone like this. Terrible terrible attitude, it wasn't crazy busy either. At the end around 9 they were cleaning up other tables and made sure to let us know they were closing soon 10pm, they were clashing dishes and shoving chairs. We settled the bill already and self packed our leftovers already, and were just finishing out beers at 9:30 and she said we're closing soon and finally squished in to clear out table and make us feel like we're in the way. The bill had 18% tip included because we're a group, and I understand that, But I feel like they didn't deserve 80$ in tips for the way they ""served us"" at all. My partner and his friends are excellent tippers, they ussually tip 20-30% when we go out because they understand the struggle of the service industry, so we're not mad about how much, we just feel like they treated us so poorly because they knew their tips were going to be good no matter what lol.I just feel so bad that I booked this for our special date with our friends and I feel like I ruined their nights. So highly not recommended. Spend your $600 at anywhere else. Bye bye YOOK, I won't miss you."|2/15/2020 21:09

Everything was great, albeit it a little on the heavy side. For a place that has donut sandwiches, I really didn't expect anything to be ""light"" and I was one million percent correct. The food is really heavy, and calorie dense, but hey - you're eating fried chicken between two donuts so make every bite count!We started with the fried pickled okra which was different and very good. It was very similar to fried pickles (salty, brine-y) but with okra. I really enjoyed it and so did my partner. Next, on to the mains! I ordered the Saucy Cock (legit could not get myself to say it and even the server just called it 'the Saucy') and my ex-girlfriend (now wife, ha) got the stuffed avocado. I really liked the Saucy Cock because it was a buffalo chicken breast with blue cheese and tomato on two un-sweet donuts. It ""deconstructed"" very nicely and that's how I ate it: first the chicken and then the donuts., The donuts were really good and reminded me of Indian fry-bread or puffy tacos if you're familiar with those things. I didn't care for the jalapeño potato salad as the potatoes were very crunchy and undercooked. The avocado was okay, but I don't think she would order it again. It was served on top of a fried donut which just didn't really go with the meal at all. It had good stuffing though, and a good filling of pork. However, I think sandwiches and burgers are what I'd stick with here. I would definitely go back, but come hungry and be prepared to not even think about health. My chicken was delicious and I'd get it again, but it was better when I ate the sandwich in separate components than as a whole."|9/30/2020 1:17

Definitely make a reservation ahead of time. This place will be PACKED especially on the weekend.General impression: This is the third time I've been to Barcelona. It's full of people mostly in 20s -30s. On Saturday night it gets really loud. You have to shout a little bit to talk, which worked out fine for our group of 4. Very nicely decorated; eclectic space. The food: Specialty in tapas or small shared plates, which makes it ideal for a small group. You can also get larger entrees to share, which will take a while to cook (we were told 45 min for seafood paella), and charcuterie (meats, cheese). We opted for the tapas. Favorites: Lobster risotto - the lobster was so TENDER, and risotto flavorful. You get thumb-sized chunks of lobster. It is a small portion but worth the taste for me Crispy rice - very unique as well. Again small portion shape of a short column, maybe the size of your palm and less than an inch in height. The TRUFFLES and sauce make this dish. Thin thin crispy outside layer, but most of the dish is risotto consistency Blistered shishito peppers - a surprising welcome in the meal. Slight heat but kind of just refreshing Churros with chocolate sauce - THICK airy churros, full of maybe cinnamon sugar, to dip in chocolate sauce. Very sharable THE BREAD: one of the best complimentary bread we've ever had. Warm and fluffy on the inside, crispy outside, thick, and slight sourdough feel. Just wonderful to dip in their olive oil. Good, but probably would not get again: Jamón & manchego croquetas - small, 4 pieces. Nothing extraordinary Albondigas - meatballs, also not unique Chorizo with sweet & sour figs - I liked the sweet figs better than the chorizo, which was too hard/dryMussels al Diablo - you get surprising amount of mussels. I generally just prefer white instead of red sauce. Thin chorizo again pretty dense Service: Very friendly, attentive, and prompt. No complaints. Cost: Bit on the pricy side. You're of course paying for the atmosphere as well. For 8 tapas it came out to $~90 for our group of 4 pre tip. Good choice for a nice night out with friends. Tl;dr: Great experience and food. The bill shows it.|2/19/2020 0:23

Loyal customers -- no more!Called them two nights back, requesting if we buy groupons, if we can do a take out order, as I have multiple fractures and am unable to climb or sit  on a regular chair / table. Got the go ahead.Bought 2 groupons for $35, one for me, one for my friend who has been driving me, lifting me, caring for me. We are two separate people with our separate items, going to our separate homes. Ordered the food. The lady took it as one order. Called to ask what the total is above the groupons, was told it is $60.60 but they will only take one groupon. I did not have an additional payment method with me and they were closing. It was near 10pm and I had not eaten the whole day, as I was working at the library, hungry, tired, in pain, looking forward to a familiar, warm meal.Spoke to an extremely rude manager, who began by saying he did not want to ""argue"" with me!He said, you can use one groupon today, and one another day, for take out. Though it would not be enough food for us, I said OK. Let me get half the food, I do not have additional funds with me, as we bought the Groupons expecting to pickup the food.He said, you want $60 worth of food to go waste?I said, no I do not! I want to buy the food, but you are refusing to give it, so please atleast give me half. We are hungry. I am in pain. we have driven all the way, I am injured and have not eaten the whole day.He said, he will give all the food, or none of it and will throw the rest out!Then he said, you want to come in here and get $60 worth of free food? I said, no, we don't want to get free food. We have paid for the groupons with your consent! Nobody said you can only use one groupon. If we knew that, we would have bought none / bought one / ordered $30 of food and picked it up! Then he said, you can come tomorrow and order the same thing, but actually today I won't give you any food!Finally he said, actually you know what, even if you are hurt, from tomorrow, I won't honor any groupons for pickup.I asked for the owner, and the manager sounded extremely nervous. He refused to give me a contact and said call tomorrow and we will see if we want to connect you! I called the next day and spoke with a lady. She reluctantly gave me the owner's name. She said he comes around 4pm. I called at 6pm today and reached the same manager! He said, the owner is out of the country! He left 4 weeks back! He is in India. I said, yesterday the lady said he is here and arrives around 4pm everyday. He said no, he is not here. I tried to reach the owner multiple times to not make this horrible experience public -- but the restaurant manager prevented me from reaching the owner.THIS IS THE treatment given to loyal customers by this restaurant. They lie, they insult, they humiliate and they deny you your order and further after advertising groupons, they try to shame you for using them. DO NOT BUY GROUPONS TO THIS RESTAURANT. They use bait and switch tactics. DO NOT WASTE ANY OF YOUR MONEY ON THIS RESTAURANT. There are plenty of good Indian restaurants in the greater Boston area who treat you with the warmth, hospitality, respect and dignity that is a hallmark of Indian culture and particularly when it comes to food. Every customer deserves to be treated with respect, and an establishment that does not respect or value its customers, does not deserve the business. Fortunately, Groupon does have good customer service. They refunded my money instantly."|1/30/2020 23:23

The menu looked on point and I'd been hearing great things about this place for a while so I was looking forward to finally trying it out. My partner and I showed up around 8 pm on a Friday and the host tells us it's a 30-minute wait - completely understandable since it's the weekend and we didn't make a reservation. About 45 minutes later we go in to check on the table and I see the host running all over. Once he is back at the stand he ignores us for a couple of minutes. During that time I get a text from the restaurant saying our table was ready - mind you I'm standing right in front of him when I get that text. I interrupt him while on his tablet and made him aware I was standing there and had gotten a text. Once again, it's Friday night and it's busy...no biggie. After we sit at our table for about 15-20 minutes and after the two open tables beside us had been seated and greeted, we finally have someone come by and acknowledge us. He wasn't our server but was letting us know the server would be there shortly. That would have been cool if he had come by when we first sat down, but not after waiting so long. When our server finally comes by about 5-10 minutes later, he treats us as if we had come in the wrong place and that we were an obligation. We order our entire meal - drinks, apps, and entrees since we had so much time to look over the menu. Thankfully, the food actually came out in a timely manner. BUT when the first dish comes out we had to wait another 5 minutes to start eating because we didn't have silverware. We ordered the muffins, they are good but not great. I mean they are muffins. Then our egg rolls come out. They are also good but not great. Not hard to mess up egg rolls. Then we receive our Crab Rice and the Shrimp and Crab gravy. The crab rice has about a 3/4 a tablespoon of crab on top and that's it - not any mixed in the rice, only a tiny scoop on the top. The shrimp and crab gravy flavor is good and the shrimp were nice sized but the rice was overcooked and some of it was crunchy. During this time we probably see our server 1 time and it was to refill our drinks - Not to ask us how the food was or to ask if we needed anything. As soon as we were done we quickly paid and got the F out. Overall this entire experience was TERRIBLE on so many levels.and y'all I don't typically write reviews when things go wrong bc shit happens but, in this case, it was collectively a bad experience from start to finish. Just do better.|1/12/2020 19:04

The three-piece plates are also pretty affordable and filling which is definitely another to reason come frequently. As for the sides, I totally recommend the macaroni and coleslaw, it pairs so nicely with the spicy chicken.The last time we came in July, we ordered takeout because we still don't feel comfortable sitting inside restaurants maskless due to COVID-19. The entrance was crowded with a large family waiting for a table and there was a group that just finished dinner walking through the door with no masks on when we had just walked in. We were within 2 feet of over 10 people in the span of 30 seconds, just trying to get to the to-go table by the kitchen which is only 10 feet away.I understand Gus's is small but we felt insanely uncomfortable picking up food with no safety precautions in place. No staff member was helping guide the flow of people, the waiting area is still directly next to the door where people enter and exit, and the waiter allowed their table to leave maskless, walking past many other people. I've been to lots of restaurants to get takeout and I have seen very creative processes that minimize contact between staff and other customers. I really thought Gus's would've thought of a better method to offer takeout that doesn't involve getting very close to others who may be maskless, but unfortunately no.I really love Gus's and I write this from a place of caring. I do not intend on coming back in person for a while unless a significant change is made. We will probably order delivery in the future. Thankfully, it's been long enough to know that we didn't contract anything, but I believe it's better to be safe than sorry.|8/15/2020 22:18

With 3 different kinds of protein, smoked brisket, Smoked sausage and smoked ham (more like a pork chop), hash brown casserole, TWO EGGS AND TOAST, there's nothing quite like it out there (or at least for this meat loving Texan). Pro tip: get their mimosas. Doesn't even matter which flavor, just take your pick - they're all outstanding.If you're doing brunch, you MUST get there before 1015. We got there at 1015 and they sat us promptly. Since we sat by the hostess station, we noticed that just after we sat down, the brunch rush started and the wait time quickly grew to 30 min and line started forming outside.Best damn brunch meal.

I was extremely bothered by how she handled the situation that I will explain below and regret not saying something directly to her when the incident occurred. This manager told a young man to ring me up which he came over to do. He was very nice. I had a coupon. Gave it to him. And since it was $12 Tuesday he took $7.50 off of my order. To cover the $12 Tuesday deal as well as my $4 off a family size pizza coupon. While he was ringing me up, this manger came over and towered over him with this annoyed look and very rudely in front of me said, ""Why did you take $7.50 off?"". The employee said nicely why and she responded. ""No, you only take the offer that is better."" It was very inappropriate for the manger to correct this employees honest mistake in front of me. Any business owner or GOOD manager who cares about their employees knows that you never correct them in front of the customer! She should have pulled him aside later or after I left and told him what he could have done different. But what also bothered me was her extremely rude and belittling tone that she used with the employee. She definitely had the I'm better than everyone, stuck up attitude and look on her face. Handling that situation in that matter was very uncalled for and is horrible customer service. I did not get names but this happened at 3:30 on 12/31. Whoever is HER manager, I hope will deal with her accordingly."|1/1/2020 0:06

What a dinner we just had at Orinoco. The restaurant had been on my list to try for like ever and I don't know why we waited this long to dine it. The place is cute and the service is spectacular. We started off with non-alcoholic drinks- Guayaba (Guava) and Guanabana(soursop). Both we were told are freshly made at the restaurant and tasted fantastic. The soursop was our favorite, and unlike the name it wasn't really sour haha.Most of the dishes are tapas style. Our favorites were- -Cocas del Dia: Spanish flatbread Guayaba with guava preserve, goat cheese, arugula, fig glaze.-Cachapas : corn pancakes stuffed with cheese-Maracuchitos: queso Paisa wrapped in sweet plantains -Yuca fries,-Verde Empanadas: stuffed with mushrooms, piquillo peppers and Manchego cheese; with a fresh greens salad.-Jardinera Arepa: Guayanés cheese, sweet plantains, guasacaca-And the cherry on the cake was their Torta fluida Dessert, which is served in this unassuming disposable foil cup. The first bite will take you back to when the simple things in life made you grin from ear to ear. It is decadent, not overly sweet and is a must order if you like anything related to chocolate.Cannot wait to go back!!|1/25/2020 15:23

They have a large open window (pretty much the length of the front wall). Having fresh air circulating gave me some sort of security. They also have contactless menus and cashless transactions.Look my first mistake was I should have come around 5:00 pm instead of 2:00 pm because the drinks were really strong, but what I needed! lol If you want just one drink for the night order the Geechee Rita. It is made the way I like it with Hennessey and Grand Marnier, don't judge me just thank me! The second favorite was the Royal Flush. It was sweeter (but not too sweet) and had a nice kick to it. Oh, you can add CBD oil to the cocktails for $10.00 more.As for the food, this is where we are minus a star. The fried crab rice has sprinkles of crab in it and it did not have the onions or veggies or even eggs I am used to having in fried rice. The Shrimp and Gravy with Crab dish was really good. I really liked the gravy. I am not sure if I was being greedy or they did not put enough gravy over the rice. I wanted a little more. You get a lot of rice and 8 jumbo shrimp. I felt like I was visiting a friend's house and their grandmamma whipped us up something real quick.The greens should be dumped up with a biscuit! I was mad that I did not order the corn muffins. (I was going to EAT my cornbread) lolThe staff was very friendly! Our waiter put up with our questions, rejections, and I think he made our drinks strong so we would simmer down. lmbo The host was super friendly, even stepped outside to take our picture.I look forward to returning and I will ask for more gravy!|10/17/2020 13:24

I understand that restaurants have been suffering during Covid, but their lobster and crab market price is 15% more than other Chinese restaurants. Also, their tables are quite close to each others, they put us right at the door where everyone can walk by and there was no space to social distance. Having said that, I still enjoy their food and the portion is very decent here.Hope they can improve and we can come back to aupport them!|11/13/2020 1:05

Dolmeh is way too sweet - overbearingly so.After watching a show about Persian food, we had a craving, so ordered via UberEats.Food: We ordered the Kubideh Kabob, the Lamb Kabob, and an order of Dolmeh. The kubideh kabob was just ok. It satisfies a craving, but was under seasoned for me. The lamb kabob however was HEAVEN! The lamb was extremely juicy, flavorful, and very very tender. The drawback from both of these is they came with about 3lbs worth of rice and one grilled tomato. Now the tomato was great, but the rice was just a waste. I love saffron rice as much as the next person, but I'd gladly sacrifice most of the rice they give for a better side dish like a salad that would give a different flavor and component to the dish. The dolmeh was way too sweet - almost like candy. Not what I expected and would not recommend.Price: Paid $73 for two kabob plates and the dolmeh. Extremely overpriced for what you get.Overall, the kabobs were solid but wayyyy overpriced. The kubideh was under seasoned, but the lamb kabobs were absolutely DIVINE. Probably won't order from here again due to price, but it's solid. Would gladly sacrifice 2/3rd's of the rice for a different side to make the plate more diverse.|12/3/2020 1:58

I could not believe this. I literally ate all of their seafood and deserts. One thing I will say they can improve on is, maybe they can have bigger crab legs. They were really small and yes they did have a lot to meet but it was Harder to open them because on how small they are. But yeah. I loved that they had peach cobbler, and it was so good. I can't sit to come back and eat some more. Also maybe they can boil some crab legs without any sauce. Some people like me, just wanna eat their seafood with lemon and salt. That is how I mine. Over all I give this a 4 because of the small crab legs but again it was all so good. I kept wanting to eat.

Today was the worst experience so I had to finally leave a review. Drove up to the drive through about 7pm on a Friday and after a long pause was told the drive through is closed at (7pm on a FRIDAY NIGHT). Ok so went inside and only 2 people inside great, shouldn't be too long I thought. The 2 people being served were trying to use a coupon and it was talking a few minutes as there was an issue. Finally the server realized the computer was down. She spent some time trying to troubleshoot it but then just started looking at her phone. The 2 customers stepped aside and I moved forward to the counter. The server never even once looked up at me or explained what happened. After standing there a bit I said hello and she just said ""you can't order the computer is down"" without ever looking up at me or apologizing. So I said ""you can't take my order?"" And she just said no. You'd imagine they could have at least still given me some food as a good will gesture but no nothing. Was even more interesting to hear the staff joke about how yesterday they ran out of fries and now the computer is down. Must be zero real management or oversight and probably just waiting to sell the location and keeping the lights on for contractual or real estate value reasons. Complete joke of a place and Burger King should close them down as they made me also annoyed at the franchise."|2/8/2020 3:33

Quirky, but I like it.There was a lot of tempting items on the menu, but I settled for the brisket benny (eggs benedict on a brisket-covered biscuit) and my friend got the shrimp and grits.

Each bite I had was an explosion of amazing flavors and seasonings that I'd never experienced before. You can tell the kitchen staff knows what they're doing.

Only, when I did walk up around the side of the building, I didn't see anyone else. The door wasn't open. I called the restaurant, no answer... tried again... nothing. So I called grub hub since they were who I had to place my to go order with. They had my order and explained that they weren't sure what was going on. Then someone walked up letting me know they weren't open. I explained I had grub hub on the phone and had placed a pick up order for today at 11:15, and if they were closed, why had I already paid and not been notified. Grub hub blamed the restaurant, the guy from the restaurant blamed grub hub station they told them 3 weeks ago they were only doing dinners. But nobody gave a damn about the position I had been put into. Grub hub said they would refund the money, but that didn't solve the fact that I was late, I had to find another restaurant, place yet another order, then wait for another restaurant to prepare THAT order.

Being from California we can be pretty bouchée to say the least. The min you walk out of the elevator the mood is set. The awesome unique fire pit is the focal point and it just made us more excited to experience this place. I'm obsessed with all the beautiful plants. It really ties the feel of that Chic industrial vibe. They do have different rules to accommodate contactless ordering which was not a big deal to us. Some items where not on the menu but  we just ordered with the gent at the bar. Again not a big deal to us to have to get up. I can see in how people said that $6 for a taco was too steep but in all honesty you're buying a quality taco. The Al Pastor  meat was perfectly marinated in the abobo sauce. You can take the Smokeyness in the sauce and the meat was charred to a perfected amount. The toppings were also fresh and it had the perfect amount of pineapple to balance out the flavors. I'm Mexican and even some locations I've had these tacos do not come close to the authentic taste of how a Al Pastor tacos should taste! My husband got the Asada nachos. Again you're paying for premium quality on the meat. The nachos were just topped with thick pieces of medium rare steak! The cotija cheese was fresh and gave the nachos that authentic touch! We absolutely enjoyed our selfs at this location. We finished off the night by checking out their outdoor seating ( we went in October) so we didn't eat outside but it was clean, chill and definitely gives you that big city vibe. We absolutely loved it and will definitely stay at the Hoxton again & enjoy a meal at Tope!|10/24/2020 15:56

Thank goodness I did! I was not disappointed. As I arrived, we parked in their parking lot. Seems like the line went fast, took us about 6 minutes to get to the beverages. This line went to the beginning of the lot. We had a chance to look at their merchandise and decide what sides and protein we were getting. We ordered the following: Beef ribBrisketJalapeno and cheese sausageCreamed cornMacaroni and cheeseGreen beansBarbecue is expensive as it is but compared to others, it's fairly priced. With staff being so nice and helpful with our decision, we were able to eat immediately and find a table. I see they do try to do social distancing, but the customers did not follow. We sat outside at a booth with this perfect fall weather that has just begun!Beef rib was my absolute favorite it was literally fall off of the bone tender and juicy! Next time I'd ask for the bark to be cut off, it just made it a little tough and salty for me.The brisket was good, I was expecting a little more. ours dried out and wasn't as juicy as the beef bone. I think I could have done without thisThe jalapeno and cheese sausage was amazing! I think I would get this again, I saw in their fridge that they were selling them frozen. Next time, I'm going to have to grab a couple links. I really enjoyed the spice level, which wasn't very spicy. I asked the gentleman before it ordered and he said that the spice level was a four out of 10. The sausage was so great with their barbecue sauce, the spicy one! Mac n cheese is soupy, just how I like it. Mild cheese flavor but complimented with bbqThe creamed corn is a must get!The green beans make you feel healthy, but they're standard. All in all, good place. With their logo being brisket is king, I hope they change something about the brisket. Juicier the better I'd say!!|9/22/2020 15:46

The empadinha de frango (mini chicken pie) is great when it's fresh; not that good later in the day, when it is served microwaved. My favorite desserts here are the mil-folhas (puff pastry layered with bavarian cream and caramelized milk) and the bombas de doce de leite (dulce de leche eclairs), but I've noticed that you can't go wrong with any of the pastries here.

Unfortunately, I left feeling a bit disappointed. It could be that I ordered the wrong item or it was an off night. We walked in on a Monday night and it was Trivia Night. Which could have been fun but it was also a little hard to have a conversation with it going on.Our waiter was super friendly but as it was his second day on the job, he didn't have much to recommend in terms of the menu. I went with the Coffee Margarita and then got the Country Clucker. The Coffee Margarita, I was a little worried about but this drink was delicious! The cocoa on the rim of the glass was a nice touch.The Country Clucker was definitely photogenic but it lacked flavor. It was a bit one note. It needed something fresh in there to lighten up the dish. I love chicken and creamed corn but you can only have so much.We decided to skip dessert after the somewhat disappointing entrees. I think I would come back one more time, perhaps to get the doughnut burgers. All in all, I did love the unique menu; I just wished I loved my dinner.|2/4/2020 4:31

I have yet to try one I didn't like. Luckily the donut truck used to be parked a couple blocks from my home and I was able to try there dessert donuts which are dangerously delicious.!

My father and I ordered the option of 1 whole fish, the spread sample platter, and three  small plate options at 49 dollars per person. Due to a wine glass and a couple of upcharges (like 5 dollars for more pita bread even though the amount we were given was insufficient for the surprisingly small portion of each spread), our tab came to 170 or so including tip for two people. The reason for 2 stars and not one is that nothing really went objectively wrong, it's that not a single thing we ordered, maybe beyond the flash fried lobster morsels with aioli (which let's be honest is hard to mess up) was very good. From my one dinner sample size, there are multiple restaurants in Atlanta with definitively better whole fish dishes and that seemingly is what Kyma prides itself on the most. Fish was a little too salty and just bland beyond that, the spreads and other two small plates were forgettable and each had us hoping the next thing that came out would be better. I usually enjoy Greek food but this just didn't really cut it. I maybe would have left a review for next visit if it was maybe half the price we paid, but the big tab kind of has me bitter, and incentivized to write one. I'm usually not one to leave a bad review unless I feel wronged by the restaurant, and maybe I feel a little wronged here in that we paid 170 dollars for something I'd rather just not pay any money for. Our server, I forget his name, was nice and attentive, service was not at all the issue and honestly may be the only ""plus"" thing I can say about the restaurant from our dinner. Kyma, if you are going charge pricing like you're one of the best upscale restaurants in the city, make sure you at least come somewhat close to that in terms of the food. I regularly dine out and pay these prices because I love nice food, and rarely do I leave these type of reviews, but ""just meh"" is the same as ""really bad"" when it comes to 80+ dollars a person for one meal."|1/31/2020 17:16

They reached out to myself and my foodie partner and I finally got to go and see! Shoutout to Jessie and also our server who spent so much time checking in on us to make sure we were comfortable and tried all the food that came in!We had a reservation around 2:00pm on a weekday. The elevators on the first floor of the Marriott was fun, you click on the floor you want to go to and an elevator with that floor number will appear :) Once you get off the elevator, Champions is right around the corner on the second floor! Right behind the host, you can see a long semi round bar with a long line of tvs for catching up on sports! My foodie partner and I were seated in a semi private area, super comfortable area for taking pictures and trying everyting, definitely felt like VIPs.They gave us the menu of selected items for us to try while we are there. The appetizers and drinks came out first. The nachos come in a huge platter, super worth, my favorite thing about this dish was the salsa, which was very well flavored! The shrimp were picture perfect! Next came 4 drinks, the 2 of us sampled all of them and in the end, Ip-Loma and Hit the Road Jack were our favorite ones :) glad we got to try all of them!The entrees came next. The buffalo chicken salad was massive!!! Also came with bacon ;) the fish and chips were delicious, looks like London fish and chips! The chipotle chicken was super tall and the amount of guac in it was UNREAL! The key lime pie was beautifully plated. It had the perfect balance of sweet and sour, neither overwhelming the other :) Overall, we had a really great experience! We appreiciate the invite and would definitely bring our friends over!|2/5/2020 18:14

However, recently, my husband and I ordered a large BBQ Chicken Pizza and by the time we got home and opened it, it was all bad. The pizza was all crust with almost no toppings and what was there was concentrated in the center. Needless to say, I reached out immediately to their GM Joe White via email. In a matter of minutes, Joe called, left a voicemail and emailed me all to apologize and offer the opportunity to remake our pizza at no additional cost. I took him up on that generous offer and called the following weekend. Joe was not available to speak at the time but another manager Tiffany told me she knew the situation and would absolutely help out with what Joe had told me he would do. I picked up the new pizza (which was delivered by Tiffany, gloved hand and all which is much appreciated in COVID times) and Joe even called to follow up with me to make sure all went well. The new pizza was completely up to the standards we've always come to appreciate at BJs. Mistakes happen and things don't always go right the first time. I believe it isn't how you fall, it's how you get back up, that matters most. Joe went above and beyond to correct a mistake that wasn't his and I definitely appreciated the overall experience I had with this location.|4/10/2020 13:52

Most of the new staff at this location are grumpy on a good day, and straight-up rude on a bad day. One in particular has turned me away twice when I've come in for coffee 15-20 minutes before closing. Needless to say I wasn't happy about that, but said absolutely nothing to them on either occasion. That hasn't stopped them from going out of their way to make sub-par drinks for me as a result. You can see how the drink in my photo compares to everyone else's. It's about 50% bitter foam. I'm not happy paying $5 for that.|6/9/2020 17:29

The jalapeno cheddar Rosens bagel was monstrous and the cheddar and jalapeno were not just cute descriptors; they each had their shining moments - the jalapeno was spicy and the cheddar was SHARP. The egg was solid (not runny) and it needed to be to carry the weight of the rest of the ingredients. The bacon was plentiful and crispy but meaty.

My friend loved the sports bar feel and all the giant TVs around the venue.  We ordered...Lobster Roll: 4/5.  I loved the butter bread and the creamy lobster.  Portions are pretty generous and I was so full! Beef Sliders: 5/5. Even better than the lobster rolls.  Great flavor and juicy patties. It came with a large side of fries.  Probably the best fries I've had!! I'm coming back for this. They also make really good drinks! We got Moscow Mules and they were perfect!  My rosé was drier than I'd like but no complaints.  I noticed a lot of guests ordered the milkshakes and I wish I had.  They looked so decadent and delicious.  The service was impeccable and my friend and I had the best time!

Not going to lie, it took us a minute to get the hang of the menu in the tablet but after we did, ordering was a breeze and delivery was fast. There is a conveyor belt that goes around with dishes to just grab and eat and like a small train looking object that brings your ordered food to your table (located on top of the belt).When we were there, we did the all you can eat, which was around $25 so everything on the belt was up for grabs. The meal was delicious and almost all side dishes were great. I think Sushi also used to be unlimited but when we went, it was not.The place is nice, clean and modern but it is not ideal for large groups. Our group (of 9) had to be divided between 2 tables since there were no options to sit us all together. Even though the tables were not too far, it still made it harder for shared conversation. Nonetheless,  the restaurant employees were very kind and service was great. Definitely a place worth visiting again.|5/25/2020 13:35

I liked this spot a lot. The menu is straight forward with the focus on fried chicken and roti, though they do have some other delicious sounding menu items as well as specials. Located in one of the brand new apartment buildings around the SE Belmont and Grand area, Hat Yai is simply decorated, with plastic tablecloths covering the table tops and metal folding chairs to supplement the seating along the wooden booths that run against the wall. This is quick casual dining at its finest. You order at the counter, grab your drinks and seat yourself. We got the Hat Yai combination and the trout special. They brought out the food as it was ready, with the combination on a metal tray. We dug right in, using a combination of our hands and utensils. The fried chicken was crisp and very flavorful - the curry sauce (just sauce) was creamy and spicy. It was so good with the sticky rice and wings. I could eat a bowl of curry sauce and rice by itself! I thought the roti was good, but a little oily. The trout came pan-fried with a thick layer of delicious herbs and spices on top of it, paired with fresh green lettuce and more herbs! It came with steamed jasmine rice and was just as addictive as the curry sauce. I'd get both orders again. To wash down the spice (it wasn't super spicy but it did have a bit of a kick) we shared a cocktail, the coconut mango horchata. Sweet and creamy, it was a good way to cut the heat, though it wasn't very strong. My only complaint about this place was that they started to turn up the music really loud as it started to get busier (but not enough for a wait to form). I don't want to be blasted by music when it's only 6pm on a Sunday and I'm just trying to eat. Bring ear plugs if you're sensitive, I guess.|2/21/2020 1:15

They only offered outdoor seating at the time and it was very limited seating (only 3 tables), so if you plan on visiting then make a reservation beforehand. They took appropriate COVID precautions such as wearing masks and offering hand sanitizer. They even offered small paper bags to put our masks in. I didn't really like how small the outdoor dining area was because you could easily overhear the other groups' conversations, making it difficult to hear the person you're sitting with. I felt like I had to speak louder in order to be heard. The food was really good but expensive. We ordered Tiger's Tears Salad with Beef + Bell Peppers, Braised Pork Belly Buns, Mama Chang's Pork & Chive Dumplings, Tea-Smoked Pork Spare Ribs, and Ginger-Scallion Bok Choy. We also got cocktails, which were really refreshing. The Tiger's Tears salad was not our favorite. It had a very strong taste (kind of like extra strong cilantro) and some bites were a lot spicier than others. The pork belly buns, dumplings, and ribs were all delicious. The bok choy was surprisingly REALLY good - it was a lot more flavorful than we expected. Overall, it was a nice experience and the food was great! I feel like this is a place you have to try at least once when you're in Boston. Because it's quite pricey, I probably won't visit too often but it's definitely worth a try!|8/8/2020 21:57

We came for lunch on a Friday afternoon.  A few other diners were present when we arrived and all seemed to be having a great experience.  We were welcomed by our server, as well as by the chef.  Both checked in with us in person thoughout the meal without being overly attentive.  My parents grow much of their own food, as do my husband and I, so we very much appreciated the attention to fresh, quality ingredients.  As a vegetarian, I also was happy to see options that we're varied, thoughtful and tasty (not just ""be grateful we have something without meat for you""). My parents enjoyed the options including meat and seafood.  We also enjoyed the atmosphere, which was welcoming and cozy without feeling crowded; I had gotten them a gift certificate to a different farm-to-table restaurant in the past that they admitted was loud and impersonal - not here!  I am so happy that we got to share this experience together.  My cauliflower steak could have been cooked longer to be a bit softer, as well as given more seasoning, but everything else we had was very good. Alquería is good for family, couples, hipsters, students, and others who crave innovative food made with quality ingredients that is still approachable and tasty."|1/12/2020 3:41

He offered wine suggestions and he was patient while we decided on main courses. We ordered two wines a red and a white, we both liked our wines. We started with baked french brie and it was really tasty! The brie was encrusted in a nice crispy shell and we were given strawberries and apples with the bruschetta to pair with the brie. I had a wedge salad, the dressing was very creamy and smooth. Our main dishes were the tilpia and crab stuffing and the fettuccine Del Mare. Both were nice and warm and delicious! My preference was for the tilipia paired with green beans and we opted for brussel sprouts instead of potato hash. Overall, we enjoyed the ambiance and the food.|2/13/2020 4:46

It's a white sauce pizza with perfectly cooked shrimp. They make it fresh so the wait time is quite long (at least 20mins after ordering). The pizza's on the smaller side (for 2 to share) and costs about $14. I'd heard coworkers RAVE about this place for years so finally decided to try it out while visiting the East Boston neighborhood recently.Unfortunately, the service left a lot to be desired. When we arrived after 8PM on a Saturday, we walked in and saw a waitress and a man plating sausages behind the bar. They literally looked at us and stared, but didn't say anything. After about a minute of or so of standing by the door being ignored, I finally asked ""Can we get a table for two?"" Man behind the table says ""You're going to have to wait."" So we wait as the waitress is supposedly off preparing a table for us, even though there is clearly at least one other empty table in view. As we are waiting, another couple walks in and man-behind-the-counter instantly greets them and tells them they can take the clean table beside the bar. This is as we are still waiting for a table to be cleaned for us. We probably won't be back, and cannot advise anyone else to patronize this place. I don't want to openly speculate as to why we were treated differently from the couple behind us, but privately I've got an idea or two. Santarpio, Boston's restaurant industry is struggling, big time. There's money to be made - if you provide good service and treat customers fairly. Your pizza is great, but the poor dining experience means I will be choosing my local pizzeria over you in the future."|11/15/2020 17:51

Really....then the food came out...... Whatever they called crab rice has not even 2 pieces of crab in it and the rice had no flavor.....then we also had the shark bites for 12 dollars and this litteraly looked like 6 chicken nuggets from Mc Donald's.....I couldn't believe it.....then the egg rolls tasted like awful...like it's been seating in the fridge for over 3 weeks....

I have to give them 3 stars, because I've been to better Indian restaurants around Austin.I love that they have a wide variety of naan! I tried the jalapeño & cream cheese, three cheese, and cheesy garlic naan. The jalapeño & cream cheese naan was the most unique, but the cheesy garlic naan was too yummy! I also had the goat curry and it was filled with so many flavors. It taste good, but it was a little over seasoned/salty. The dish came with jasmine rice and it was nice and fluffy. I'm willing to come back to see what else they have to offer, but overall this seems like an Americanized Indian restaurant.|12/15/2020 23:37

If you can bear the line (which can be ridiculously long during peak lunch and dinner hours), the food is worth the wait. Don't expect a place to hang out after you eat, though - it's more of a get in and get out type of place. The best part about Danbo is that you always know what you're getting; food is consistently delicious, and you can customize your ramen according to a variety of elements such as spice level, richness of broth, noodle type and firmness, and toppings. Highly recommend bringing friends from out of town to try it!|1/7/2020 0:20

Ive never had prime rib smoked before and it was really good - the texture ends up being slightly less soft than traditionally cooked prime rib, but that's more than made up for with the Smokey flavor.  Also came with a generous serving au jus that really took it up a notch.  Didn't realize it was a finish off at home meal but that was fine cause it was pretty easy and I was happy I could eat my prime rib right out of the oven (instead of it probably being a less ideal temp by the time I took it home).  The Caesar salad was great with the cornbread croutons, paper thin radishes and Parmesan.  Also came with Texas caviar (cold salad of black eyed peas, pickled celery/cucumber? and generous amount of fresh dill yum), roasted potatoes (had instructions on how to reroast these at home as well), a whole pint of strawberry shortcake ice cream, and four cinnamon buns to bake yourself the next morning.  I couldn't finish my 1 lb. prime rib, so saved about 1/3 for later.  Husband had no problems eating all of his though.  Really enjoyed this meal and would totally do it again if I lived here :)|9/27/2020 1:44

It is not a normal order, but it is their regular bagel with egg, bacon, and cheese, minus the cheese. The manager told me straight, ""no."" I said why I order it all the time (as I am allergic to eggs), so I pay FULL price for the sandwich with just the cheese and bacon. The manager proceeded to ask me if I had ordered this modified sandwich there at his specific store. Well, my husband was not having it and proceeded to tell him that we order this sandwich from this store. I had just been there a little over a week ago. I believe that the manager did not know ow how to input this order into the computer and so he just told me no. He put our order in. He asked if we wanted to donate our change to charity as well. My husband, being annoyed, said no, and the manager did it anyway. Not a great experience at all. Maybe hire managers that know how to take customer orders and respond with respect."|2/4/2020 3:29

I purchased gift cards during the shut down (that were stolen in the mail) and the manager, Cameron, reissued them to me at their full vale.  And these weren't cheap.  So, that goes a long way to earn my praise.  But, that's not why you're likely reading reviews.  It's usually all about the food.  And they do not disappoint.  It's almost impossible to find an authentic Italian restaurant (contrary to what you might think) here in Austin.  The lasagna at Gusto has to be at least 5 inches tall, full of layer upon layer of noodles & homemade sauce.  My favorite is the vegetable, but the meat is equally superb.  Happy Hour?  One of the best in town!  I met my son & his girlfriend there yesterday just in the nick of time.  Whew!  How can you go wrong with a $6 frozen bellini right now when we've got nonstop 100+ degree weather.  And because of it was 105 outside, we dined inside.  This is not something I take lightly.  I felt very safe, with seating spread out appropriately.  I've read through recent reviews and noted that the now auto-included service fee of 20% at Gusto is not very popular with some reviewers.  I'm not going to lie.  Personally, I don't particularly like having auto-gratuity unless I'm part of a large group, BUT I totally understand why they've gone this route right now.  So, if you're contemplating a visit to Gusto, GO!  Small businesses need our patronage and this neighborhood place is one of the best Italian restaurants in town.|8/29/2020 18:04

The noodles could be cooked for maybe 5 more seconds to make it a little softer but otherwise, it was perfect. Thanh Nhi was my old spot but since they closed, I had to find a new one. And this could very well be it. The size small was also more than filling for me too. My fiancé got the fried egg rolls, large pho, and iced Vietnamese drip coffee. He said the egg rolls were very good. A little greasy but not more than what you would expect--it's fried afterall. His large bowl of pho also stuffed him full and he usually eats a lot. His coffee was also good but that's hard to mess up. I would definitely encourage everyone to come try their pho! They also respected distancing and mask guidelines.|10/24/2020 19:49

The fish is fresh and buttery.  The crispy fry is perfect.  Honestly, it was way better fish n' chips than I had in Ireland.  Tip:  Drizzle on some malt vinegar and enjoy their fine tartar sauce. The thick-cut fries are not usually my favorite style, but I devoured these.  Tip: Sprinkle the fries with some of the red seasoning salt they have available. The coleslaw was also really good!  Lots of peppery seasoning and raisins added for natural sweetness. I will definitely return for my fish n' chips / coleslaw combo cravings.

We had the brisket, sausage with cheese and jalapeño, and the beef rib which was the size of my forearm. Holly hell it was amazing. They cook/ smoked black magic that mean into perfection.

They have adapted a little for Covid, and I'm afraid that means the cool bar scene is mostly gone, though there is a nice outdoor grotto to enjoy by the fire.  Menu is mostly the same, although I think some of the mezze are streamlined.  Still many good things to choose from.  If you've not been before, try the fish and mezze dinner.First, you'll get all four spreads, which are fantastic.  I don't even like egg plant usually but the babaganoush is excellent.  Then you'll pick three mezze.  The lamb pie is exceptional, so if you like lamb, get that.  Cheese saganaki is really good, and the octopus is also.  We tried the calamari sauteed last time, but it was quite fishy and management promptly replaced it with apologies.  During warmer seasons they have great salads, especially a watermelon and tomato salad with feta that rocks.  Then you pick a fish with about half a pound per person in your party.  Their standard roasting is fantastic, but you can also have it cooked encased in salt or in bamboo leaves.I'd suggest trying their wine list.  It's really unique, and you can pick all kinds of Greek wines, which are reasonably priced.  Their guidance is good with the selections.  Personally i enjoy their cocktails, which are interesting and unique, but this is the place to try ouzo if you so fancy.  It will be served with ice and water, which you need so that you can dilute to your taste.|1/11/2021 16:25

They're all about popovers, which are a unique pastry-bread that resembles Yorkshire Pudding. I ordered the Pop Benny, but I was informed that they didn't have ham. She used sausage instead, and I thought I'd be disappointed but it tasted great. Consider that substitution even if ham is an option. Having it on a popover instead of an English muffin was cool. I also got a mocha; I am kind of a coffee noob, so I'm not a good judge of anyone's coffee. This was fine, but for the coffee and the Pop Benny I paid over $18. Boston prices I guess? Fine, but I'm not from Boston so I definitely think a caveat is in order about the prices. That said, that Pop Benny with sausage? Delicious.|1/18/2020 23:11

Brisket was nicely done, as was the sausage. Nice smoke and flavor, tender but with a nice bite. I like that, fall apart BBQ isn't my thing, it needs to have a little chew to it. Cream corn was a little bland in my opinion, but the slaw was outstanding. 3 sauces on the table, original, spicy and sweet. They were all good, but the original was the ticket for me.

I'm not sure about ""organic"" produce or fruit, but hey, you can't have everything. It's very busy later in the week, but the waitress staff is very nice and accommodating. Thanks, Babica Hen Cafe, for helping out people like me who have to be picky with what we eat because of health issues."|2/16/2020 6:13

Been here quite a few times over the years. It's a hipster place that's inside an old garage. It's expensive, and the portions are small, but it's really good food. I'd say this place is worth checking out. They have some other locations now too.It's a bit snobby, and it's hard to get a seat for dinner cause this place gets packed. The millennials overflow it so they can get their $15 avocado toast or whatnot. Still, the food's good and the atmosphere is good. I'd check it out for a special occasion or something. It doesn't have the feel of an expensive place and has a casual ambiance, but it's pretty damn expensive.|3/1/2020 18:38

Inside it was kinda dark and dull so wE seated in the patio.We ordered house coffee, cuban con leche, terra taco, Luna taco and artist taco(egg, cheese and potato). Coffee is good, cuban con leche, it tasted like a regular latte.It took around  15mins to get our food, on the menu and lady at the counter told Luna And terra are large taco but we dint feel it aNy large it was regular sizEd taco just open taco, for the quantity and quality of the food we felt it was overly priced. Tacos weren't bad but nothing special either other than the potato's which are like shoe string fries which me n my kid liked it. Tacos came with regular salsa.There were couple of flies while we were waiting for fooD but once food arrived it was like a flies attack, we dint wanted to take everything and move inside so me n my husband finished  it fast, my son was kind walking around and eating, it was kinda irritating.If we're in the area, we'll grab a regular coffee but not the food.|6/15/2020 17:25

When we arrived there was only one other table seated. We each ordered a wine flight. One of the glasses in my dining partner's flight was clearly past its prime--smell, appearance and taste. She politely asked our server if it could be replaced. His reaction was like he bottled the wine himself and was offended, but he brought a replacement glass which was clear and tasted as it should. He still proceeded to argue that the other one was off color because it was the bottom of the bottle; thereafter, he never came back again to check on us. It took us two hours to share one appetizer and each get a salad. Food was fine but not in the mood to be treated poorly. Too many other patio spots with better wine lists.|8/21/2020 19:17

Came thinking we'd do the Portland dining meal, but waitress tempted us with the last 42 ounce 28 day aged Tbone.Corn Bread:  4 stars, got 2 orders not the best but good could have been sweeter and more crispy One order of Dining Month:  4 stars, salad was awesome/crispy/great bite,  Elk meat loaf over mash potatoes was awesome, desert of sponge cake was MEH 3 stars.  Another criticism is why not a few choices for each course, too bad.Shrimp and Grits: 4 stars good bite and tasty Char Sui Pork: 5 stars a creative and tasty meat with wrap and side of veggies that was tasty compliment.The downfall of the meal? The 42 ounce Tbone.  When you charge 150 bucks it better be good, it was disappointing.  Picture looks far better than taste.  Imagine hard to go a big steak good so if you charge 150 better deliver, while center was cooked right edges a bit too overdone, I can accept that, but all the slices were neither tasty, juicy nor tender, epic disappointment.  Nobody even came over to ask ""how was the steak"" if they did I would have said TERRIBLE Sitting area was nice, ambience and layout very cool.

I've never had it prepared this way, but it as really good.  A good mix of cheese, veggies and spicy chorizoFor our entrees I ordered the Gringas con Mole. I typically am not the biggest fan of mole, but the flavors and way it was prepared was really good. Not too heavy. It was served with white beans and sautéed veggies. My date got the chicken street tacos, which he said were really good.The Queso Fundito did a good job of filling us up so unfortunately we weren't able to finish our entrées.We both ordered cocktails, I got a Paloma and he got a house margarita. Our total bill was about $70, for three drinks, one appetizer and two entrées.  Overall it was a little pricey, but a good date night spot. You will not be disappointed.|1/1/2020 20:54

What a bad ass and kind, humble young man. Wish I got his name. He was a cool dude though and I appreciated learning about what they did. After the tour, the food did not disappoint. Holy cow. I've never had a beef rib this large in my life... the pudding was to die for. All of it was fantastic. And it was great to see how efficient they were at handling a large volume of business. We had a great time sitting outside too... but really the tan gentlemen working the smoker and wood stuff really put the trip over the top. Thanks guys!|3/21/2020 17:39

The wings were fall off the bone good.  Literally the meat was falling off the bone and seasoned and cooked to perfection.  I haven't experienced that EVER.  The eggrolls were crispy on the outside and all the food stuffed on the inside was equally proportioned.  You didn't get more rice than cabbage or shrimp, which is rare.  Most restaurants like to tease you by over stuffing their dishes with the cheapest ingredient but not Virgils.  Kudos to them for that!  I am really enjoying the restaurant options popping up in the East Point/Camp Creek area.  Virgil's is one that I can say gets it.  The food here is really good and the ambiance gives off really good vibes.  So why the 4 star rating instead of the 5?  Well, it's simple, I come to a restaurant to eat and fellowship with friends.  I want to enjoy the food and company not fight for a seat or yell over a DJ.  They have clubs for that.  That's my biggest complaint about most ATL restaurants, everywhere is turning into a turn-up spot instead of what it's intended to be.  I know it draws a larger crowd but I'd take the quality of my experience over the extras.  It doesn't allow your servers to engage you and it doesn't allow the patron to really be able to take everything in.  ***NOTE***Parking is scarce in this area so try to get there before the 6pm and after crowd comes so you can get a parking space and a good table.|3/7/2020 23:33

My boyfriend ordered to pick up the first night, it was sooo good that we had to come back next day for lunch. The BBQ smoke as well as smell permeates throughout the entire parking lot.

I want to preface this by saying I love meat but I definitely did not miss it one bit while eating this meal. Here's the FAST (Food Ambiance Service Trendsetter) ReviewFood: 5Delicious. I made my own bowl with all the ingredients I love. I loved the eggplant and the crunchy chickpeas. I also had the gojuchang sauce. The roasted broccoli was also great! I normally wouldn't rave about something like that but it was just overall great combo of flavors!Ambiance: 3It's a fast casual place. Nothing out of the ordinary to write aboutService: 5 Again, fast casual. Very fast service. Also they were very helpful in helping me decide what I wanted. Normally I would go for shiitake but they let me try it first before ordering because some people don't like the texture of it. Trendsetter: 4I guess I cambridge there's a lot of vegetarian/vegan places popping up. But this is by the far the best one I've been to and they have more interesting options than the rest!Go wholeheart provisions keep doing what you're doing!!!|2/1/2020 4:18

Let's just say it exceeded my expectations!! We got 2 sliced brisket sandwiches, original sausage, the sides we chose were pinto beans, mac n cheese and green beans all small and we still had left overs. I had a sweet tea loved it, it wasn't too sweet just right. The sandwiches were so soft the meat and the bread it just melts in your mouth! The price wasn't bad at all I thought we were going to spend way more. I must say the way they do combos there is a little confusing but the staff was so nice to explain it to us. Overall I get it 5 stars, I recommend everyone to go!! I will definitely be coming back.|11/4/2020 23:35

We took off a star for a couple of reasons. One was because some, probably managers or owners (men in button-down shirts), weren't wearing masks even when making drinks and belong with all the heaters. Plus, our server wasn't correctly wearing his as it was not covering his nose and sometimes not even his mouth.  When I come back after it has been open for longer, maybe I can change my rating. I appreciated the fact that since they didn't have their liquor license yet that they had a list of complimentary drinks from their cocktail, wine, or beer menu available while you ate. This place opened during Covid. They have twelve heaters on the patio. The wall to the restaurant is open, so the air is flowing through the interior. The bar is very well placed as it is in the restaurant's center with one side outside. There is a gorgeous mural on the far wall of the restaurant. There were so many options on the menu we wanted to try that I came back with a friend the next night. The only thing I got the same with her was the veggie dumplings.  My hubby and I started with the veggie dumplings, which could use more veggies, in my opinion, and a plate of hush puppies. There were so many hush puppies with an excellent mayo-based sauce. Our tip would be to get the mussels as we did and save some to dip the green curry sauce. It is the best combo. The green curry mussels were our favorite item of the night. There were lots of mussels, and the sauce was fanatic. We asked for a spoon so we could get it all. Our entree was the lobster Mac and cheese as I can't resist a Mac and cheese, especially in a new place. The fusilli pasta and the smoked Gouda cheese sauce was phenomenal. When the dish arrives, you think there is a ton of lobster in it, but the red you see is mostly tomatoes. I was disappointed that there were only two lobster knuckles in the Mac and Cheese. The next night my friend and I got the spring rolls and knew that they are not fried. They were good, but more like a typical basil roll. Our fault for not reading the description in the menu and just assuming it was fried. We picked the crab fried rice as our entree, and it was delicious. There was lots of crab meat in it, and the fried rice was very flavorful. I will be back to try out more items on the cocktail and food menu.|12/28/2020 22:54

A big group of my friends who are raw vegan knew about this place and expressed absolute amazement at how good it is. A few people said it was even their favorite restaurant in ATL. So delicious. Yes you have to wait in line. There's not a whole lot of seating. And it took me 30 minutes one way to get there. But y'all it was so worth it. I have a friend that is an amazing chef that has never been and told our group that it looks like just kale on a wrap and we were all like...but it's more. It's so hard to explain the magic of it, but it's one of a kind. By the way, I got the punany and hubby got the south of the border!

I waited about 20 minutes until I got my food and be seated (cafeteria style). You choose your sides and how much meat you want. I ordered the beef rib and it was huuuuge! One slice of beef brisket and half a cheese cheese link. Sides were green beans, mac and cheese and banana pudding for dessert (pudding was the only thing I wasn't pleased with). Man, the meat was so delicious and tender and  there was a lot of it. It's hard to imagine the other famous BBQ place tasting any better. I would definitely return here again. I think I'm starting to salivate thinking about the food.|1/9/2020 17:18

Bella Italia popped up and had good reviews, so we decided to give it a try.  Upon arrival, we were immediately impressed.  It's really nicely decorated inside.   It looks a bit upscale, but it's a casual dining establishment.  They have outdoor seating which will be nice in the warmer months, too.  The service was fantastic throughout the meal, and every dish was delicious.  We started with wine and the complimentary bread, accompanied by an order of Calamari Fritti (fried calamari).  Everything so far was delicious and spot-on.  The salads came, too.  It was already a lot of food. LOL.  There is a great selection of traditional and non-traditional Italian dishes on the menu.  For my entree choice, I immediately drifted toward the Francese Chicken, or Chicken French as it is known in Western NY where I grew up and is very popular.  (History: the recipe came to NYC with the first wave of Italian-American immigrants and became known as ""Veal French."" Eventually, the recipe migrated to Rochester NY's large Italian-American community, where the chicken was substituted for the more expensive veal.)  It was very flavorful and tasted like some of the Chicken French I've had back home.  And, yes, I ate every last bit because I didn't want to take home any leftovers.  A month later, we were going out to eat with some friends for my birthday, and I suggested Bella Italia because I had a fantastic first experience there and my friends had never heard of the restaurant, even though it's a short drive from their house in Horizon West.   Again, it was an excellent choice and we had a great time with some amazing food.  This time, I opted for the Gnocchi Mediterraneo, another good choice.  The gnocchi tasted fresher; different from the ones I typically buy in stores.  The dish was very flavorful with all of the added ingredients that comprise a Mediterranean diet.  Although I love both entrees I've ordered, it'll probably take me awhile to circle back to them because there are so many different entrees I want to try on their extensive menu.  The prices are reasonable, too.  Not super cheap, but not super expensive.  You have to factor in that you get bread and salad included as well.  One of my friends tipped off our server that it was my birthday, and she brought me a complimentary cheesecake that was freaking amazing.  She also thankfully didn't make a big deal about it and sing because I hate being the center of attention like that.  It tasted different from regular cheesecake, and I wondered if it was ricotta cheesecake.  The texture was creamier.  Deliziosa!We'll definitely be back to Bella Italia again and again and again.  And now we've introduced it to new patrons who will hopefully return and spread the word as well."|2/25/2020 16:00

This may be more personal preference, but as someone who loves asian cuisine, the fusion flavors just weren't my favorite. I was hoping for some indication of the original flavors that the dishes were based on, but it was far from expectations. The decor was pretty cool, but man was the restaurant crowded and located in the middle of nowhere. The waitress kept bumping into my chair as she walked by, and after waiting 40 mins, we ended up sharing the table with six other strangers. The portion sizes were also smaller than I would have liked considering the price.|1/11/2020 22:33

You can have spinach or arugula to replace potato but who can resist potato cooked in duck fat-so I had to try and it was yummmmy! I just find the Berkshire roast pork was a bit salty and the St. Cyrille curd was not melted so there was a bit of chunks in it. I kinda missing the brown butter hollandaise sauce. The truffle was mild and didn't overwhelm the overall dish. Overall the dish was good. My boyfriend had the  The wilD BOar spalla-  he liked it but it could be better if the meat is slightly thicker. The mEat was very thinly slicEd, just can't  appreciate the taste of the wild boar. We also tried the French Toast Trifle-The briochE was a little bit soggy (probably dipped in bAtter for long) missing the pistachios. The meyer lemon was sLighltyy missed in taste-it's missing the tartness thAt will help compliment the dish as a whole. The torched palvova didnt complimenT the plate. Pavlova supposed to be crunchy in the outside and soft mallowy in the center. It could be better if they used a merigue and tOrChed it  or no pavlova at all.

This is hands down is my new favorite spot in Texas for some real deal bbq. My boyfriend and I stopped here after our flight into Austin to spend some time in Texas hill county. It's a la carte style here so you pick out your sides, the sizes, and the drinks which are in coolers all around you ... then on to the BEST part the meaaattt! The last counter is where the meat lives. It's deli style so you pay by the pound. Of course we went with brisket because brisket is king around here. So glad we did it was to die for! The brisket had a perfect flavor with the right amount of fat. The cornbread was warm and took me right back to childhood. The cream corn was the real gem for me, creamy and addictive. However, the Mac n cheese stole my kids heart right from the jump. The a la carte style was perfect for my family because we love buying a bunch of different things to try and to our surprise the prices were great! Nothing we had here do we regret ordering. We will be back and I cannot wait! I recommend this to anyone that knows some true Texan bbq. Little side note, the drink special was a black margarita- a margarita with a hint of black cherry? Not to sure. I do know that if it's available- go ahead and treat yourself.|7/16/2020 15:37

This is not the golden brown crispy sweet honey glazed walnut shrimp you would expect. Instead it was four pieces of shrimp tossed in a mystery white sauce that was most likely mayonnaise. About as disgusting as it gets. Fortunately, the $15.50 portion could have fit in a couple of shot glasses. The General Tso's I asked for medium hot, was soggy and completely tasteless, the broccoli beef equally tasteless. The soup noodles were also tasteless but had the added yuck factor of mushy not fresh noodles.

He seeemed to be bothered with any request, and did the bare minimum with a slight attitude. The food took a long time to arrive and was also incredibly lackluster. The other bar staff never spoke, and used their bare hands to stack straws, which I found to be so unsanitary. If I ever were to stay in this hotel again, I absolutely wouldn't patronize the bar/restaurant. No one deserves a tip who can't even be bothered to say ""Hello"" or ""thank you"".

Susan our server was very friendly, gracious and knowledgeable about all menu items and was very quick and appeasing. Many beers on tap and available along with wine and full bar. Menu has many items to choose from such as old classics as Scotch eggs, Chicken curry pie, Cornish pastry, fish and chips, battered sausage, beef and cheddar Sarnie and much, much more! We decided on the turkey club with fresh turkey, british bacon, onions, lettuce and tomatoes on a toasted Jackson. My Cottage pie was packed full of delicious meat and mash potatoes on top! We ended on a very sweet note of a fresh cream donut which was like a fresh baked jelly donut with a mountain of fresh cream on top with a drizzle of strawberry drizzle on top. Come on Sunday's for a full Roast beef or roast lamb dinner. This is a fun place with live bands on Saturday at 8pm, karaoke bingo on Tuesdays, and trivia on thursdays. Plenty of parking and restaurant is completed COVID Compliant.|10/10/2020 16:36

This place was a little far from the hotel that we were staying at but it was worth the trip. We ate here on the last day that we were leaving the conference. We want to go to Franklin's but they were still closed and rebuilding after a fire.They open for lunch at 11:00 am and we got there a little before they opened and just hung around. You walk in and you order your food cafeteria style. The meats are sold by weight but because I don't eat a whole lot, I ordered 1 pork rib and 3 slices of the fatty brisket. I chose the  pinto beans and potato salad as my sides. I really love the fact that Texas BBQ, the flavor is all in the rub. There were three bbq sauces at the table original, sweet, and spicy sauce. You don't really need the bbq sauce but I mixed the original and spicy sauce together since the spicy sauce packed some heat.The fatty brisket was very tender and it just melted in my mouth. The pork rib meat just fell off the bone, and very well seasoned. I don't remember the pinto beans but I did love the potato salad. My friend got the sausage and he let us try a piece of it. Homemade cheddar and jalapeno sausage was juicy and packed with a lot of flavor.By the time we finished, the restaurant was packed and people were waiting in line outside. If you don't want to wait, go right when they open at 11:00 am or at an off-hour. If you love the food and want to take some home with you, the do vacuum pack the meats so that you can travel with it.|8/29/2020 3:48

Placed an order online for 30 piece. There was no option to split the flavors (soy garlic, spicy, and sweet crunch) equally, for 10 of each, so I left a note hoping to modify it. There were options to split 50/50, but not 3-ways. I quickly received a call saying they couldn't do a 3-way split. I understand it's likely a company policy, not employee enforced. Why make a needless hurdle to try all 3 flavors? They're sold as 10-pieces in the small size, so they're already portioned for a 3-way split- it shouldn't be difficult to accommodate. Dumb policy.After the woman on the phone told me they couldn't do it, I asked my family if they wanted to cut a flavor for 50/50 or adjust order? She let out the longest, most over the top sigh, ""UGHHHH"" at my audacity to ask my family for input. She was incredibly, over-the-top rude. For flavor, don't bother with the sweet crunch. There is barely any flavor to them."|6/1/2020 15:55

Having not driven down Guadalupe in a while due to COVID I was saddened to see so many business shut down. 2 doors south of wheatsville coop was Bikkle Jamaican restaurant, and a bright neon sign ""open"".  I knew I had to go as my honeymoon has many fond memories of Juicy Patties. When I peered through the glass the place looked closed but that's just because there is no seating during these strange times.  I saw to the left the cashier with some customers. There were also some patties gleaming from the enclosed hot display case. Everything looked very new. I found out they had just opened last week. I ordered a beef and a chicken patty. Both were delicious, tasting like the patties were made with love. Crunchy and crispy with flavorful meats inside. Tasted just like what we had in Ocho Rios. Next time I will try the beef and cheddar cheese patty. It is bold for a restaurant to be opening during this time, but by offering high quality tasty fare I expect Bikkle to be able to withstand these hard economic times. Please support them if you can!"|10/10/2020 20:46

Terry Black's was highly rated and now I understand why. The ordering process was quick and friendly. We all got a bunch of different meats and by the end of it, we actually probably all had every single meat option possible and we had every other side also possibilities. And honestly the Rumors about this place are very true it was probably the best barbecue I've ever had in my whole entire life. The food and meat were so tender and moist that it was awesome. The sides were also really great as well, I really enjoyed the potato salad. They also have a little bar where you can get free bread and sides and each table has different sauces that you can use, which were also really great and I really wish they added a little bit of a spicy sauce but the regular barbecue ones were very good as well. The customer service was amazing. Everyone was very friendly.|8/16/2020 16:03

My husband ordered 1 microbrew tap beer and I ordered a Lemon Drop.  My Lemon Drop came in a small martini glass and was more like LEMONADE!  I could swear there was no booze in it.  I'm not a big drinker.  I might have three drinks in a week.  So I asked for a shot of Stoli vodka and that 10.00 Lemonade turned into a 19.00 Lemon Drop.  Our waitress seemed to be in a sour mood.  She barley gave us the time of day.  She never once came by after she dumped off our entrees to ask how everything was.  I will take my business elsewhere next time we're visiting or traveling using the Amtrak station train.  Damn shame!|1/4/2020 13:50

Maybe it's my fault for thinking it will get better. My main reason for writing a review is the quality and cost. Kelly's is perhaps the worst value of any restaurant I've been too. My wife and I got a lobster roll and a roast beef combo. It cost $40. That's absurd. The lobster meat in the roll was wet and mushy. Hard to determine what part of the lobster it came from. The actual roll was good but very small. The roast beef was sliced pretty thick. Not sure if it was just an oversight or what but I was surprised by the thickness. It was a very average roast beef. I've had much better at smaller places in the north shore. The fries that came with the combo were undercooked and inedible. Not very good at all. Overall I'm pretty sure this will be my last time at Kelly's. It always leaves me unsatisfied, underwhelmed and wanting more.|3/7/2020 18:34

It appears to be Vietnamese inspired as they also offer Pho on the menu, hoisin sauce, and spicy sauce on the table. The soup is creamy and contains milk which makes it unlike more traditional ramen places that use concentrated bone broth.

So incredible. We didn't make it to Franklin's and heard that this place was actually better! I'm so glad we came here. The line was long but only took about 20-30 min in total and we got a beer while we waited.As far as the food, we got sausage, brisket, and pork ribs -- all were incredible. I know TX is known for brisket but I actually thought the ribs were better! And as for sides, we got green beans, Mac and cheese, and creamed corn. These really made the meal, in addition to the cornbread!!!!! Don't skip out on it. It was warm and so buttery! This spot is a must!|1/20/2020 16:08

Take out only! The food was delicious and fresh. The truffle fries ($6 during happy hour) tasted amazing - I tasted the truffle and the garlic aioli was superb. Since I usually go to cactus club for the service and atmosphere, and not the food, i'm not quite sure if their regular price for these items would be worth it for take out... but check out their menu online for the prices - I think the burger combo would totally be worth $25 (tasty angus beef and side salad), but I would definitely not pay anything more than $15 for the poke ... just because you can find it somewhere else."|4/16/2020 22:12

Before the pandemic, the line can be exceedingly long during regular meal hours but that's because visitors and locals alike LOVE Terry Black's! The line usually goes by pretty fast and best part is, you can order a beer to drink while you wait! Positioned just across Barton Springs Road from a beautiful park, Terry Black's not only serves great BBQ but also a beautiful view of greenery and downtown.My Go-To Order:- Drink - When in Austin, always have a local brew. There are so many to choose from and you will not be disappointed! Terry Black's has the traditional open coolers with ice and beer while you wait in line to tickle your fancy. - Sides - You cannot go wrong with their mac & cheese and their sweet creamed corn! - Meats - My personal favorite is the brisket! So juicy and flavorful that you do not need their BBQ sauce but if you'd like to try them, they are a wonderful complement to their cooking. The sausage and ribs are pretty good but like I said, don't make the mistake of not ordering the brisket.If you're debating dropping by, go eat at Terry Black's! Don't be mistaken for it being a chain either, there are multiple locations of the Black's family BBQ but they are not chains. Support local ATX restaurants!|6/5/2020 15:43

We heard great things about terry blacks and read glowing review on Yelp so had to give it a try. We arrived on Presidents' Day around 10:30 when it opens at 11am and there were already 4 people in front of us. By the time the door opened there were already over 50 people in line. It was astonishing! As we went up to order, the servers asks what you like to order and cuts the meat in front of you then puts it on a tray. Then, it's self seating. The sides range from Mac and cheese to green beans. We ordered the Mac and cheese, pretty good and melted in your mouth. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary though. For meats, we got the ribs, brisket (both fatty and lean), and the sausage. The pork ribs were our favorite as they were perfectly sweet and salty. I thought the fatty brisket was a lot more juicy and tender than the lean brisket. The sausage was very flavorful as well. I'm no BBQ connoisseur, but thought it was a great alternative to Franklin's as I'm not willing to stand in that ridiculous line for hours!|2/24/2020 20:56

Pros:Nice settingCons:Food I came here for lunch with a friend. It looked perfect since I was craving noodles and she wanted sushi. She got the spicy tuna roll and I got the Dan Dan noodle lunch special. It started off well with a warming bowl miso soup - yum! And then it was all downhill from there...  My friend's spicy tuna roll tasted fishy. It was a fine portion but not something I'd want to order again.My server got my order mixed up. I didn't really notice at first because I ordered the Dan Dan noodle and was a saucy black bean noodle with chunks of pork belly - she had brought out the Xian noodle instead. If it wasn't for the fattiness of the pork, I wouldn't have realized it wasn't beef..which tipped me off that I was served the wrong dish. After flagging down the server and getting the right order in, she brought out the Dan Dan noodle.She brought out a big bowl of soup with bright bok choy and thick slices of braised beef. It looked promising, albeit confusing, since dan dan noodles are not a soup noodle dish. The beef was fine but I didn't eat the rest of the dish since the broth was basically a diluted vinegar. I tried adding the chili oil to mix up the flavor a little, but the chili oil at our table tasted stale.. I think the noodles had good texture and chew, but couldn't enjoy it since it was saturated with the vinegar broth.|1/14/2020 20:42

However, times like this, I decided I should just do it and support local small businesses.Tassili's only take online orders and no longer does phone in. I'm detoxing during this pandemic and have been eating only raw foods. Therefore, Tassili's fit my agenda.When I came to pick up my order, there were already a handful of people outside waiting. A few didn't know they had to order. The others were waiting for their order like me. Within a few minutes, I got my order.The wraps were wrapped very well. I ordered South of the Border chili wrap, Full size, spicy ($1 extra), Alapoopoolala seaweed wrap, Half size, spicy ($1 extra).OMFG, these are so good. If you want delicious, healthy, vegan raw food, look no further, this is for you.Drools. Both are humongous. Could not finish either and took big bites of both.If I had to choose one, which one I prefer more, I would go with the Alapoopoolala seaweed wrap. Not cause it has seaweed wrap but what was inside the wrap was so delicious. I only wish I have some right now to eat.22/2020|4/18/2020 0:07

First off, their food naturally looked Instagram worthy even with the sides! And secondly who knew the food would taste as good as it looked! Definitely can judge a book (or meat) by its cover here. Burnt ends: Probably the number one winner of the meal. Juicy and as tender as can be!! I can feel it melt in my mouth. That piece got annihilated immediately. Brisket: Better than the average brisket. Far from tasting dry and boring, but possibly my least favorite compared to the rest. Still delicious though! Sausages: We for the original one, the cheese one, and the cheese and jalapeño one. My favorite was the cheese one because the cheese oozes out of the meat the moment you bite into it. So yum! They're all good though, even the plain one! Turkey: I had very low expectations for this one since it looked so bland and boring, but the way they smoked it gave it a flavor I never expected. My boyfriend usually dislikes turkey but he definitely gobble gobbled this one up! Pork ribs: maybe my second favorite it was like eating a pork version of the burnt ends. It was SO tender that the meat even melts off of the bone!! Extremely enjoyable. This review is long enough so I'll just say do not skimp out on the coleslaw and Mac and cheese! Though I was also pleasantly surprised at how tasty and not bland the sweet corn was. Sides are fantastic and complements the even more fantastic meat. Best bbq place ever!|8/9/2020 0:25

The basic formula is to combine simple, yet distinct western Chinese flavors--think a lot of cumin, chili, and lamb--with stretchy and snappy Lanzhou-style noodles.  In this category, the Xi Xia Stirred Noodles (youbomian) and the Dapanji (""Big Plate Chicken"") are flavorful and delicious, though I wish the latter used boneless chicken, which isn't authentic but would definitely make wolfing it down easier.  Though the owner Sha Luzhou is from the province of Ningxia in western China, he's made accommodations for other dishes from elsewhere in Asia.  The Shanghainese Hong Shou Rou (braised pork belly) was tasty, but the Taiwanese Salt & Pepper fried chicken was disappointing, it didn't taste particularly juicy nor was the basil flavor noticeable. Overall though, Xi Xia pairs its terrific noodles--made by National Noodle in Powell--with simple, homey, comfortable dishes like tomato over egg.  At this price point, it's a terrific option for a meal."|3/7/2020 22:23

I ordered ahead and they had the food ready upon arrival. The sliders are great without a dud amongst them (I haven't tried the non-meat ones though). The true crown of this establishment though are the smothered fries. My hubby and I went there and could have just shared the fries and been fully satisfied and stuffed. The Philly fries, specifically, really hit the spot. Is there truffle oil in there? I don't know... but whatever it is in there has my mouth watering just writing about it. There are a couple of outdoor tables and everyone was masked when I went in to get my pickup. So many yum points to this joint!|11/30/2020 23:31

We enjoyed a lovely patio seat and even though they were busy, our food came right out. All of that aside, they could've served us our food an hour late and in a dog bowl and I would still have no other choice but to give it rave reviews. The food was insane. We shared loaded fries and a few sliders each and every bite was better than the last. I genuinely gave myself a stomach ache because I ate so much so fast. I couldn't fucking stop, it was just too good. I took a slider home and hours later, at room temperature, it was just as bomb. I won't be able to stop fantasizing about it until I go back, which will be as soon as I possibly can. Highest of recommendations.|10/11/2020 18:04

The best way I can describe it is an old-school Texas BBQ joint that can match - if not top - all of the bougie BBQ joints and their contrived waiting lines any day of the week. I like La BBQ as much as the next person, especially for their great pulled pork, and I've had Franklin's BBQ, but refuse to stand in line just because they unnecessarily choose to have one. That said, I'd out Terry's brisket up against either of those joints and their beef ribs? I don't even like beef ribs, but I'd go back again for Terry's.

From the fresh made corn tortillas, to the fresh chips in the eggs, to the fresh avocado and fresh salsa's. I can't forget their Aguas Frescas! Love, love, love Aquas Frescas! In fact over the course of a few days, and in the best interest of science, I took it upon myself to sample all of their flavors. For the record they were all excellent with my favs being the watermelon and cucumber. They do have other tacos here that unfortunately we didn't get to try because we were too busy eating their breakfast tacos.

It's a bit dark inside (mood lighting, and all that), and several of us were trying to use the battery-operated table candles to read the menu. Our server came over with a pen light to help out. Then came the food.

Went in on a Saturday morning and luckily it was crowded. I ordered the blueberry basil glaze and apple fritter while my friends ordered the Mexican hot chocolate and chocolate ganache (which I got a bite of each) - The blueberry basil glaze was a good balance of sweet and a hint of savory. The donut itself was perfect (soft and chewy at the same time) kinda wish they sold regular donut holes and I could  eat a tons of those. - The apple fritter was fresh and crunchy. Must try if you love apples. - The Mexican chocolate was okay for me. The texture is more like a cake than donut so if you try it don't think of it as a donut but more like a cake. You also get a hint of spicy at the end. - The chocolate ganache, what can I say... you  really can't go wrong with it if you're a chocolate lover. The ganache was overflowing, gooey, and luscious. Overall, everything was great and I'd definitely go back if I were in town again.|1/18/2020 17:07

We wanted to try a burger place, and I've heard a few things about here, so we decided to try it out. At 11AM on a Wednesday, there were barely any people inside. We were promptly seated and got taken care of. The inside has three big booth tables, and since there weren't anyone there, we chose there. It was comfy and spacious. The inside is really clean and brightly lit.I got the butcher cut burger along with the oreo milkshake. At the time of the visit, Yelp gave me a 50% off for a small milkshake when I checked in (so make sure to check in to all the places you visit!). The burgers came out in about 15 min after ordering. The burger itself was pretty alright. It has the following: angus beef, emmi roth bleu cheese, melted onion, frisee, pickled shallot, red wine jam, soy truffle vinaigrette. The patty itself wasn't that big. It was juicy, but the size was overshadowed by the toppings. I think it's mostly due to the imbalance of the frisee compared to everything else. It's not to say that burger was bad. It tasted a bit fancy and refreshing, not like your regular burger. However, I do wish the patty was a bit bigger, especially for the price.The milkshake was pretty good too. There was too much whipped cream on the top, and it fell in a minute after the server brought it to us. Fortunately, she saw it, and took it back to remake the topping.Overall, I would rate this place a 3.5 rounded up to 4. It's on the more expensive side and I wish the burgers were a bit beefier, but they still taste well made, and the service is top notch!|2/6/2020 22:08

We arrived at the restaurant and the restaurant was relatively busy, the norm for a Saturday night. We were seated and waited about 10-15 minutes before any wait staff greeted us and asked for our beverage order. After our waiter arrived, our waitress took our order and there was little to no attention to our table throughout the experience. One of my guests had an incorrect order and no one was present to address it. In addition, our water was never refilled, fries were cold. We brought up our concerns with the manager who offered to provide a new burger to-go to my guest but never fully addressed the issues related to the overall service. I felt considering the poor level of service the manager should have provided a more significant discount on our ticket. Needless to say, but after tonight's experience I will no longer be going to Flip. Very disappointing after patronizing the restaurant for years.|3/1/2020 2:34

The location can be a little tricky to get to, I suggest parking behind the Dominos in the alley way, for quick in and out service! You can even place your order through instagram, and I was called right away to confirm it! Be sure and ask for onions and pickles, if you want them, and don't be shy to customize!!|6/9/2020 18:10

The steak was tender and the rendered fat melts in your mouth! Every bite was awesome.*Side onion ring ($12) ~ ultra crispy and well seasoned. The Aioli it came with was very refreshing. Always a must as a side dish!*Side risotto ($18) ~ flavours were on point, nicely cooked. If you prefer a softer consistency I'd tell them as it comes a bit firmer than usual but in our opinion it's good as we prefer a firmer consistency.*2X Char cosmo ($28) ~ this was a server recommended drink perfect for someone who likes sweeter/fruity drinks! Pineapple and mint! Super delicious you can't even taste alcohol. (I don't drink much but when I do I like fruity drinks).*Gatsby ($12) ~ non alcoholic drink. Not worth the price. The flavours were more sage/pineapple which I wasn't a big fan of.*Chocolate cake ($16) ~ delicious. Passionfruit chocolate lava cake! 109% delicious with the hazelnut!*Warm apple ($15) ~ best one yet I am obsessed with this! Delicious apple tart with a nice vanilla icecream.* 9/10 ~ so delicious loved every part. Wish the risotto was a bit softer and hotter.* 7/10 ~ the pricing isn't cheap, nor is it too bad.

A nice, creamy pasta dish with grilled chicken and mushrooms. Plenty of chicken pieces and each of them a nice size. A wholly of pasta too. Very filling. My son ordered a Sausage and Mushroom Al Forno. He loved it. It was immensely cheesy (almost ""too much"" he said) and had just the right amount to fill him up for the night. To top it off, the garlic knots were lovely, not overwhelming like some places. Add to that, a nice salad for the boy and a bowl of sausage soup for me and it was a fantastic meal.

I had no idea they were so popular. I made my pick-up order via Grubhub and applied their $7 off promo, resulting in my total charge being only $4.82 - I ordered Tarka Dal. It was accompanied with basmati rice and a side of red chutney (?) Not sure if I was supposed to receive complimentary naan with it or... I do feel as if that was the missing component to this.All in all, I was pleased with my meal. I haven't had Indian cuisine in many years; I'm glad it was this restaurant that I chose to order from. Furthermore, I'm not sure if I have to specifically request utensils to-go but I didn't receive any in my bag. I had to duck into Star Market to grab some. Not worth knocking a star off though.|2/22/2020 5:52

Meg T and I were looking for some place to go for brunch and decided we'd tried Phoebe's Diner. Have to give a shoutout to the Yelp waitlist option as the bulk of our wait was actually our drive to Phoebe's versus standing outside in the crowded parking lot waiting to be seated. We were seated within 5 minutes of our arrival and the place was bustling. It's just as you would expect as a diner - a casual atmosphere with good looking food at the tables and a lively sound level. I had specifically wanted the Carrot Cake French Toast, but was advised by my waiter that it would be too much for one person (too sweet) and to consider it as a dessert to share only. So, I got some tater tots and fresh fruit to start and then shared with Carrot Cake French Toast as dessert. The tater tots were outstanding. The Carrot Cake French Toast would have been too much for me on my own - it was rich and sweet. I enjoyed it, but think that the citrus flavor could have been omitted. But don't get me wrong, I did eat every bite of my half :)|3/15/2020 15:44

Stuffed with either ground beef or veggie. Both were good!Goden Tibs- these are prime ribs cut into chunks and sautéed in their Desta sauce. so good! it was recommended we try this instead of the other items. Meat Lovers- Chicken, and Lamb were both very flavorful and saucy. The fish was the only thing I didn't like. It was in a curry but I personally felt like I wasn't tasting much. Sides: Tomato Fitfit, Miser, Potato Stew. Cant recall if I loved or hated any of them to be honest.Dessert: Baklava (always a good idea), Dulce de leche cake- nothing phenomenal but good nonetheless.Environment/Vibe: 4/5Not too loud like a nightclub, but also not a quiet/calm dining experience if thats what you're looking for. just the right amount of music in the background, movement, and conversation.The only issue for our group was the wait time.

She did eventually go and ask someone in the back (allegedly) and came back saying that is only for their new location elsewhere. I dont do business like this, but went ahead and got some food since I was with others - otherwise I would have walked out already. Everyone had jerk chicken which was mostly black and dried out. The rice and peas with the curry gravy on it was tasty, and so were the few plantains. 1 bathroom, which is clean , as well as a small sitting area with bar stools . I was only in the area for a special occasion, and will not return.

As you would expect from how quickly their reservations go. - However, despite all the tables being full, the noise level was ideal, an underratedly very important aspect of a restaurant. Loud enough to feel fun, but quiet enough to have companion/date/friend/relative/enemy. - The decoration is rustic and Spanish themed yet they were playing electronic and dance music. Odd combination! Drink: - They have an extensive, if not overwhelming, wine list with several moderately priced bottles. If you order a glass, you also get a choice of two different sizes.  - The cocktails looked good and were surprisingly cheap. None of the flavors particularly stood out to me. And with Boston's all star drink culture, I've seen better. Food: - I will admit that I'm not a huge fan of tapas or small plates. When I'm hungry, I feel much more satisfied after eating an entire plate. However, I enjoyed everything we ordered. My boyfriend and I ordered: the spicy eggplant caponata; the tortilla; the hanger steak; the empanadas; and the shishisto peppers. And the free bread is so good. Our favorite tapas were the EGGPLANT, the TORTILLA, and the SHISHISTO PEPPERS.  - We also ordered dessert, the flourless chocolate cake. It was a circular cake with a warm molten, chocolate interior and crunchy almonds on top. What more can you ask for! Service: - Fine. Could've been more attentive, but we were never struggling to get their attention. Good for: Dates, Girls night Out; Drinks and Apps|3/13/2020 18:29

I was very disappointed in everything.  I ordered the tuna as appetizer, it was unimpressive but ok.  I had the steak for entree.  I was expecting grilled steak but I got something that might have been sous vide steak that doesn't have a nice brown outside.  It was awful.  I also ordered a side of asparagus, it was also cooked weird, not grilled, not pan fried, not sautéed, not quite steamed, covered in butter.  For dessert I was given the world thinnest slice of cake, it tasted like nothing special grocery store chocolate cake.  I was charged PER GLASS of iced tea.  It was not specialty iced tea in a bottle, it tasted like good old Lipton iced tea.  I was not advised up front that I would be charged per glass. When we left, they had washed the sidewalk outside with very strong smelling bleach, I was trying my best not to get it on my shoes.  The chairs are extremely uncomfortable. There's a way better French restaurant on Park Ave, try there instead.|9/21/2020 21:02

No? Just me? Even when getting or making a meal that didn't come out as well as I'd like, I try to focus on the positive.  Unfortunately, Chez Vincent made it incredibly difficult to do so and I didn't really find any tonight. I'm not looking to  bash on restaurants, rather just wanted to share my honest experience.Very disappointed with what was supposed to be our last Magical Dining meal of 2020. We ordered from Chez Vincent to go, which we thought would be a treat. Boy, what a let down. We ordered the escargot and blackened tuna. Neither came with any kind of bread or anything to eat with. The escargot was alright, but nothing special at all. The tuna looked so sad and messy. It didn't seem appetizing at all. My partner said the sauce on the tuna was way too sweet and could barely get through it (we don't like to waste food in our household so we do our best to eat what we have). I'm wondering if it's the same sauce used for the grouper I ordered as my main dish. The fish itself was dry which explains why it was drenched in this sickeningly sweet sauce. I was disappointed in the very small portions. The sides were like something you get on a free airline meal. My partner ordered the pork tenderloins which were smothered in a creamy sauce which was also very sweet (seriously, what's up with this place?). The mashed potato tasted like pure powdered parmesan you get from the can you forgot about in the back of the fridge. This was not an enjoyable meal at all. I think I'll pass on the sad looking desserts. The creme brulee looked burnt and the chocolate cake seemed dry. Unfortunately, we won't be eating at this French restaurant again. Any recommendations for a good French meal in Orlando?Update: As much as I loathe wasting food and it breaks my heart, I simply can't get through our meal. What a waste of $70+.  This hurt my bank account, especially since we don't have the luxury of dining out at nice places often."|10/27/2020 0:01

I initially tried to go to Franklin BBQ, but got there way too late.  But, I wanted to try BBQ one last time before leaving Texas and I saw this on Yelp.  I got there around the tail end of lunch time, so there was a little bit of a line to order.  I waited around 30 minutes and ordered the brisket and beef rib.  I asked the lady who was cutting the meat if she can give me some burnt ends, and she was SOO nice and gave me a ton of burnt ends.  If you like this, I would suggest asking them.  Once you get your food (I did skip the sides except for some jalapeno and salad), you can self seat yourself in the HUGE dining area.  I had no problem finding a seat and I started feasting away.  The ribs and brisket were SOOOO good, fall off the bone, and drool-worthy.  As I write this review, I can still think about how good it was. The BBQ sauce that they provided was also pretty amazing.  Once I finished, I had some leftovers, so I got a togo box to feed on later.  (I ate the leftovers in my next hotel).  If I wasn't at the beginning of my road trip, I would have loved to buy some meat that they had pre-packaged.  Terry Black's is definitely on my must come back when I am in Austin. If you have some time, I would suggest a pit tour, where the guys cooking the meat will show you how they cook the meat.  It was pretty informative.|4/6/2020 18:52

I was expecing the $$ double money sign to be a sign of this place being somewhat expensive, however, I think it was actually very fairly priced. Most entrees were 8.95 up to $13ish. I really thought that was very fair compared to most asian restaurants I've been to throughout my life... granted that's throughout several states.... The food portions were hefty. I ordered the dinner size sweet and sour chicken with a side of white rice and side of lowmein. My fiance ordered the shrimp fried rice. The sweet and sour chicken portion was HUGE!!! The low mein side was a hefty portion as well. The shrimp fried rice was an adequate portion ... but ... there was like 3 peices of shrimp in there... so that was odd... my fiance insisted I don't say anything so I didn't... but I typically would have expected more shrimp ... no matter how large the sizes of each individual shrimp are. I didn't like that when I asked for a little more sweet & sour sauce to-go they said they'd need to charge me... kind of odd thing to charge for. Although... they didn't charge me for extra veggies in my entree... so ... I can't figure out the logic here.The service was ... sub par. It was 4pm when we visited and the bar tender was the only person on the floor and I had to try to yell across the restaurant to ask about the drinks and order. The drinks arrived FAST so that was nice. We were not checked on at all after we received our food so that was odd. We didn't have to wait long to get our check after we were done eating so it seems as though the bar tender was keeping an eye on us regardless of the lack of check-ins. The food was ok. The sweet & sour chicken was standard taste because of the sauce, however, I totally loved that they brought it out with the sauce on the side so it kept the chicken nice and crispy wihtout getting soggy. The lowmein was a little underwhelming... I ended up not eating it at the restaurant and taking it home to fancy up with some spices and soy sauce, which ended up being excellent once I enhanced the flavors!As we were finishing up, it seems as though one of the owners came out to work the bar. The reason I thinks he was the owner was because she was extremely friendly and welcoming and when I almost left my favorate jacket she stopped me and I was SO thankful. She just had that.... above and beyond touch... so... hopefully she rubs off on her staff! :) Overall.... alright. Might be back... but wouldn't be my first choice before trying the others in town to assess the competition.|11/13/2020 23:49

We turned around and went in and ordered the three meat plate to go. We get home and realize that none of the meats had ever been touched by smoke. But the overcooked brisket did taste a little like liquid smoke. I called them and asked  them why, and was told i could come down and talk to the manager if he wasn't busy.

I have Spaniard in my DNA (I can't deny that) and I require the best Paella to please that need  in my Life. One day I decided to search here in Yelp. Best Paella in Boulder or Denver. And I came across to Dagabi Cucina I called curious, I wanted to make sure. And that was all I needed in my life. The most extraordinary service, exquisite food, quality ingredients. And mostly the most attentive Chef and Host. Chef Antonio. Since I grew up eating Paella in almost every important occasion, I started to ask questions regarding the authenticity of the ingredients and I traveled through the best possible Spaniard Menu but in Boulder Colorado. One of my favorites the Sangria paired with the espectacular Paella, created by Chef Antonio. It's has been over 2 or 3 years. Visiting Dagabi was like visiting my Spaniard Brother who was always waiting with the best versions of Paella: Paella de Carnes, Paella de Mariscos, and the seafood and meat Paella with Verduras. Sometimes asked personally by me which is the absolutely best Paella. Sorry, I'm obsessed with Paella. And Chef Antonio and more authentic Paella that you'll find in Colorado and maybe in the 7 different States I had lived so far. The best in my humble opinion. Chef Antonio became our friend and Dagabi the best culinary  experience in Boulder/Denver Area! Gracias Antonio!|8/17/2020 4:28

Not only do they do a pretty damn tasty albacore/tuna/salmon/avocado roll, but their dan dan noodles are impressive as well. Noodle purists will probably call their noodles not chewy enough, but they have about 8 different 'shapes' of noodle that you can choose from, so maybe a thicker one would have achieved 'the chew'. Personally, I liked the texture. It was chewy enough to be hearty but not to exhaust you. Perhaps unsurprisingly for Texas, the best part of the bowl was the beef - melt-in-your-mouth tender and plenty of it! I ended up pouring the entire accompanying sauce tray into my bowl in an attempt to reach the levels of numbing/hot that I desired, and to balance out the slightly overdone vinegar. It never quite made it."|12/2/2020 19:12

They said it happens all the time! I believe the bf got the Degen Eggel which he really, really liked. I got the Bacon, Egg + Cheese with cream cheese subbed for the cheddar.

I've been several times over the years usually when I have family or friends visiting and would highly recommend getting the lavender latte which they are famous for along with their homemade waffles. Sorry no gluten freewaffles yet but our waiter, Marcelo said he's hopeful one day they will offer a GF waffle option? Since I usually order the tagine (tomato stew with chickpeas, olives and comes with a small merguez aka - lamb sausage) and 2 poached eggs, which is a classic French Moroccan dish that exemplifies this restaurant's cuisine, and just the right amount of indulgence. But, as I wanted to change it up from what I typically order and wanted something lighter to save room for their waffle with the lavender latte to finish off a fabulous way to enjoy Sunfunday in this not so fun rainy weather. I ordered the Le Thon, ras el naout (Mediterranean rub) seared tuna with quinoa/greens and it was delicious. Even though, it was before 11am, Marcelo was kind enough to check with the kitchen if they could accommodate it earlier and they did (expressed my gratitude in his tip). Now for dessert, you choose from several dipping sauces (optional) for the waffle and my friend ordered the chocolate lavender sauce which complemented the lavender latte perfectly. My friends enjoyed what they ordered and you cannot go wrong as everything on their menu is on point. Tip, go early to put your name down.|1/19/2020 23:07

After our day in the Aquarium, we chose this place mainly due to the rating and the proximity. Boy, were we in for a surprise in more ways than one. Situated on the second floor of 60 Andrew Young Intl Blvd, the entrance and the decor gave a nightclub vibe. The valentine's feel was strong as each table was accompanied by a candle and a rose. The menu is on the pricey side with each Kabab entree being around $20 which is to be expected from a place as grand as this. You can never go wrong with the classic adana, so we opted for lamb and chicken adana platters which included rice and salad. One came with alioli whereas the other had tzatziki. Both condiments worked well with the whole platter combination as well as the juicy and flavorful kababs.

Ricky was very friendly when I walked in, making me feel like I had just walked in as a regular.  Taking a seat at the bar, I got a Jai Alai, which is always delicious and decided on one of the shareable appetizers, the crab pretzel.  When I said I wanted a bite, I was hoping to get a couple things off the menu.  However, you definitely want to get someone in on this pretzel.  It's delicious, but it is enough food for one person to make a meal out of it.  It was chewy, crabby, and certainly filling.  However, I found myself wanting something more, maybe a dipping sauce?  Something along the lines of a butter dipping sauce or maybe something with a bit of spice, especially old bay?  Just a suggestion, but other than that I really enjoyed the meal.

One of the best fast-food burgers I've had. The fries were crispy and almost addicting. The queso sauce on the side was eh: not strong enough and looked artificial. The chocolate/vanilla shake was okay: not my favorite flavor and not filled up all the way, but it had a nice thick consistency.

I wouldn't pay $10 for the shrimp appetizer it is delicious but it's a small serving. I did enjoy the crab rice and the potato wedges. I stopped by on a Saturday around 2 with a group of 4. We were seated quickly but the weather was bad. I'd probably make a reservation if possible. Two things weren't great: Drink service took forever. The website brunch lists $15 bottomless which is what initially brought us in on a Saturday. When we arrived they said it's only Sundays so plan accordingly.

My friends and I were a little hungry after exploring around the Animal Kingdom so we looked at a map for options, and it lead us here. Despite not having a reservation, we only had about a 25-minute wait, which was not bad at all. Our waiter Juan, was on top of everything throughout our meal and was very accommodating with all of our needs. The only thing that was more fire than the service was the food itself. Yak and Yeti really have their unique concept of Indian/Asian fusion down pat.The Korean Beef BBQ Bimibap Bowl was everything, and I'm still thinking about it a week and a half later. All the ingredients were just fresh, Yes Gawd! The tenderness of the beef, the flavor of the sauce, and the crunchiness of the tempura vegetables just made for the perfect entrée, which I highly recommend. My friends and I also ordered Korean fried chicken, firecracker shrimp, and ahi tuna nachos to share, and those were all pretty damn tasty as well. Even the desert pear lemonade was arguably the best glass of lemonade I've ever had.  Also, let's not forget about the slice of decadent moist chocolate pudding cake I had to wrap up! Ooh, wee. *rubs belly* *licks lips*  All in all, The food at Yak & Yeti is just bomb. Please do yourself a favor and try to eat here if you find yourself planning a Disney vacation.|3/26/2020 0:04

The pulav i had ordered had $14 on the menu and the bill said $16. I was told the menu were old and the price hadn't been updated. However, this has happened to others as you can see in other reviews  which gives me an impression the management is aware of this and aren't making it right. Good y'all for deceiving your customers.Don't mean to crib about $2 but this isn't something you expect from a restaurant in USA.

There's really nothing extremely bad or extremely good about this chain.. although I will say their kale Caesar salad is great and I love the addition of Brussel sprouts and pistachios. While their food quality is consistent, unfortunately I've come home multiple times and realized they missed pieces of my order. Luckily I live in the Battery so I can just go downstairs to have it remediated, but for those who might get delivery etc. just watch out. For example, one time I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps (along with other items) and only received a container with the lettuce and the sauce so I had to go back for the actual filling. Another time they forgot our fries. Nothing life threatening, but I would expect a large chain like Yard House to implement a process for their servers to double check bags especially during this COVID time where it's really focused on grab-and-go.|9/30/2020 21:36

McKay's Breakfast and Lunch isn't the kind of place you come to if you want a hipster-approved brunch of deconstructed avocado toast with a microgreen and foraged-enoki-mushroom omelet. McKay's is the kind of place you come to when you want to give your arteries a workout. Since my cholesterol level was looking so good, I decided to ruin it by ordering the full Irish breakfast. And I mean the FULL Irish breakfast - two eggs, bangers, Irish bacon, white pudding, black pudding, beans, home fries, a grilled tomato and buttered toast (I opted for whole wheat - I mean I AM trying to be health-conscious).I was quite impressed for several reasons. First, despite the fact that there was enough saturated fat here to fulfill your weekly dietary needs, the meats weren't overly greasy. The sausages were cooked very well - they had a good flavor and a nice ""snap"" when I bit into them. The fact that there was both white and black pudding was a real treat. They were both tasty, but I preferred the white, since it was a little less dense than the black version. Neither the black nor white was dry, though, which was very nice. Irish bacon is sliced differently than the stuff you'd get with a Grand Slam, and this bacon was on the chewy side, which is how I like it, but if you prefer crispy bacon beware. I was also impressed by the beans - they were sweet, but not too sweet, and were a nice foil to the salty meats and eggs. It's easy to botch the beans with a breakfast like this, so I was pleased that these weren't just a ""throwaway"" addition. Someone gave them some thought. My eggs were done well, fried hard the way I asked them to be, but this is a breakfast joint, so I'd expect that much. I only have one complaint with the entire meal. The home fries were really, really salty. I mean, I ordered the Irish breakfast, so clearly I'm not concerned about consuming too much sodium. And even I thought they were salty. I mean, I still ate them of course. . .once you've gone 3/4 of the way through a full Irish breakfast, you need to finish strong, but they definitely could have done with a lot less salt. Overall, though, an exceptional breakfast. McKay's is clearly far more than a run-of-the-mill diner. Also, it is worth nothing that all of that food pictured (I could barely move after I finished it) only set me back $12.95. Ya'll can keep your hipster avocado toast, I know how I'm spending my money."|5/5/2020 13:57

Truthfully, I ordered an americano because the guy taking my order told me the drip wasn't great. The americano was not great either but I went back and ordered a breakfast taco and it was incredible! It was loaded with eggs and potatoes, which was all I had asked for. I really enjoyed it and the potatoes were long and crispy and were overall just a very good pairing. It was very loud in here and I could see myself coming back here with my friends but probably never to study again. Great vibe and fun lighting. The people that work there are all very cool and hip as well. It is a pretty large space with lots of seating and I peaked out to the back patio even though it was raining and looks super super cool! Service was good: a guy brought my stuff out both times. I also spent some time looking on their advertisement wall and found some cool services that I am going to use in a resource guide for one of my classes.

Do make reservations tho, because we originally came on a Saturday night and there was a 90 minute wait so we left and came back another time but made reservations.|2/18/2020 18:33

Medina Cafe literally has the best waffles ever. And their main breakfast/brunch dishes are amazing too. I had the Fricassée Champignon, which was a mixture of potatoes and mushrooms in a rich sauce with arugula and two poached eggs on top. It comes with a piece of bread that's perfect for dipping into the left-over sauce from the fricassée. As for the liège style waffles, I originally got one with the white chocolate pistachio rosewater topping. They have a range of very creative and original topping flavours, including raspberry caramel and milk chocolate lavender. The waffle was so good that I got seconds! And I would definitely go back just for the waffles. There is almost always a wait because of the cafe's popularity, so go early and put your name down. They're very organized, however, and will send you text updates if you give them your phone number. I highly recommend this spot to anyone visiting Vancouver.|2/23/2020 14:36

The food is thoughtfully made and presented, and the bar options are great. Would prefer if they had their own Margarita mix instead of using bottled, but I can get past that. One other thing is the guacamole, tasty and is super fresh, but $7 for a side not much bigger than like a third of a cup is a little steep for me. All that considered, the price is fantastic, and the staff are friendly and accommodating.|3/10/2020 16:43

Lines are insane and wrapped around the corner of the store. People really love their donuts I see. So much hype about this place. In my opinion, I like this place more than Voodoo Donuts. I got the Lemon Poppy Buttermilk flavor. I really enjoyed my donut. It tasted fresh, soft, and not overly sweet. I would order this again. Depending on what time you come and how busy it is, some of their donuts can be sold out. It will take some time to make more. Love watching them torch their creme brûlée donut. All the donuts looked cute and aesthetically pleasing. Love the interior, especially the full size prints of the donuts that offer. Good lighting and a nice hangout spot with plenty of outlets. I think it is worth checking out. If I was in the area again, I would come back to try some of their other flavors.|3/29/2020 23:14

It wasnt the best I ever had. But good. Compared to what we get in this area (Bawarchi, Viceroy, Moon, Bay Leaf) this is the best among all of them. Order take outs feel like a hassle. Our fellow biryani loving friends are too hungry and standing too close. Somehow they are thinking that if they come too close to the person in front of them, line moves fast. Odd people. These are guys who fight at ""The theater ticket line"". Then every one thinks they are a VIP and want to cut the line ""because they ordered online or on phone"". So special right? Well my friend, its a take out area. ALL THE OVER-INTELLIGENT SPECIES LIKE YOU HAS A SMART PHONE AND EVERYONE ALREADY ORDERED, AND IN LINE TO PICK UP AND PAY. Well we saw this false self-entitlement most of the Indian places. Quickly reminded me how we lived in India. It felt like a real trip to Vijayavaada, not Hyderabad. Not the food part but the waiting in line and experiencing the wonderful self-entitlement and dominance of a Telugu habitat. Lol. Over all, food wasnt bad. I wouldnt bother going to the place if you dont want drama. Anyways, I would pay a bit extra for a delivery service and not worry about facing these folks."|10/2/2020 12:46

My husband and I easily placed our order for a Pepperoni pie online, waited about 10 minutes at their pickup window, and made our way back home. First bite, YUM. Second bite, WOW. Third bite, GONE. The crust is so flavorful and crunchy. It was so delicious. I'm sitting here now, a day later, and still thinking about it. If you're debating, give it a try. Can't wait to go back and I hope them come out with some type of cheesy bread next!(Didn't even have a chance to take a photo beforehand since we were too busy chowing down.)|8/22/2020 21:21

Word to the wise: plan your parking ahead of time. Finding parking here is difficult even in dreams! Haymarket garage is one nearby option, and there is parking at the waterfront. Though, if you're going to wine and dine, take an Uber or the T. NorthThe North End is known as Little Italy, and for good reason! Narrow(-ish) streets, lots of brick and stone, and of course, TONS of options for food, drink, and some more in-between items like a barber shop, realtor, etc. Even if your hair is cut, your stomach full, and you are on a Cannoli detox, the North End is still a superb neighborhood for taking a stroll and just exploring.P.S. Mike's Pastry is the famous one, but Modern Pastry is absolutely worth a visit!|12/4/2020 15:42
